## 🤖 AI Components

### CVSS-Context Model

Our novel neural network enhances standard CVSS scores with application-specific context:

```python
from ai_components.cvss_context_model import CVSSContextAnalyzer

analyzer = CVSSContextAnalyzer()
result = analyzer.analyze_vulnerability(
    cve_id="CVE-2023-XXXX",
    base_cvss=7.5,
    context={
        "service_exposure": "public",
        "data_sensitivity": "high", 
        "environment": "production",
        "incident_history": [...]
    }
)

print(f"Adjusted Score: {result.adjusted_score}")
print(f"Priority: {result.priority}")
print(f"Explanation: {result.explanation}")
```

### Explainable Anomaly Detection

Multi-modal ensemble providing human-readable explanations:

```python
from ai_components.anomaly_detection import ExplainableAnomalyDetector

detector = ExplainableAnomalyDetector()
anomalies = detector.detect(metrics_data)

for anomaly in anomalies:
    print(f"🚨 {anomaly.severity}: {anomaly.description}")
    print(f"🔍 Explanation: {anomaly.explanation}")
    print(f"💡 Recommendations: {anomaly.recommendations}")
```
